#Waveshare Screens

Waveshare provides an outdated Raspbian image with all necessary touchscreen drivers pre-installed. Obviously we’d like to run a more current version of Raspbian, so this is how we can have our Pi and eat it to. 

##Waveshare Screen Output Configuration
* ###Option 1 - Non Switchable (NS)
  * Outputs to both HDMI and touchscreen.
  * Convenient, but potentially low framerates.
  * Excellent for use as “Jukebox” screen - connect it to a couple speakers!
  
* ###Option 2 - Switchable (SS)
  * Outputs to either HDMI or touchscreen.
  * Takes ~10 minutes(?) to switch from one display to the other.
  * Emulate a gameboy!


Each of these have different variations. Raspian support is being completed,and support for retropie with kodi as well as individual support of each.
